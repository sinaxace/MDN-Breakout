# MDN-Breakout
This repo is mainly just an intro tutorial from MDN to practice using the HTML5 2D Canvas with the requestAnimationFrame function in JavaScript.

Note: The only significant changes are that the paddle follows the mouse cursor's x position using a mousemove event handler. You will find bonus features too cause that's the best way to have fun with these kinds of projects ;)
